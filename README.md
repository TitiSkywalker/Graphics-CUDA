# Monte Carlo Ray Tracing in CUDA

This project implements Monte Carlo ray tracing in CUDA.
In another repository, I have implemented a more powerful ray tracer in C++, accelerated by MPI. If you are interested, you can check out [here](https://github.com/TitiSkywalker/Graphics).

## Table of contents

## 1. Installation
**Windows 10 or 11**. I'm not using any system kernel function, so maybe it will also work on Linux and macOS.

**Visual Studio 2022**. This project is created and build by Visual Studio, because I don't know how to install CUDA on Windows without installing Visual Studio (I have been searching this on the Internet for a long time).

**CUDA 12.3**. I have a **Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050** graphics card. It's valid if you have other versions of CUDA, because I'm implementing almost everything. All I need is ability to invoke kernel function and access shared memory.
